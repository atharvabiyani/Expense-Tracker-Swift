<h1>Notes üìù</h1>
This expense tracker iOS application is my first project developed using Xcode, and I faced a lot of confusion at first during the learning process. As a beginner, understanding the Xcode interface and the Swift programming language presented a decent amount of learning. However, I dedicated time to online tutorials, seeking help from developer communities, and practicing hands-on coding. The experience taught me invaluable lessons about iOS development, and I'm happy with the progress I've made. I hope this repository can serve as both a testament to my learning journey and a useful tool for others interested in developing similar applications.
